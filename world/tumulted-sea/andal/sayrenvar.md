title: Sayrenvar
---

**Sayrenvar** is the capital city of **Andal**. It wraps around the huge **Sayrenvar Inner Harbour** and spreads onto the **Morku Plain** beyond, far enough east of the **Evening Horizon** to avoid the **Eclipse**. Sayrenvar is the center of the universe for all of **Andal**'s wealthy politicians; the country's five oligarchs live in the city and rule from it, as do the rulers of many other cities in Andal. If it were more admitting to diplomats, there would also be significant international activity. As it is, most of the traffic through Sayrenvar Inner Harbour is trade from other parts of Andal and only one in ten ships hails from **Sibal** or **Leuber**.
