The elves who live in the [[Elking Wood]] are the only surviving remnants of the ancient elven kingdom, once ruled by [[Oeged Naaftet Oecheisev]]. The kingdom collapsed long enough ago that elves alive now have only heard stories of the kingdom and its fall from their grandparents or great-grandparents.

The elves live in small groups spread out through the forest. After the kingdom's fall, werewolves and basilisks slowly wore away the people's strength until they were forced to retreat to more defensible hideouts. Now they struggle day to day as their numbers slowly dwindle.
