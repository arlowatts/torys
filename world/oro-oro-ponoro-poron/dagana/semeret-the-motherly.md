title: Semeret the Motherly
---

Semeret the Motherly, a capable elemental mage, is the leader of the Dagana clan. Like all the leaders of the Dagana clan before her, Semeret was selected by [[Dagana the Azure Death]] to rule. Unlike any previous clan leaders, however, Semeret has no interest in warfare. She instead prefers to foster supportive relationships with other clans. In particular, Semeret spends much of her time mending the relationship between Dagana and [[Lukurru]], which was sullied by centuries of war.

## Personality

Semeret takes on a gentle tone, even when pressed. She is often willing to compromise and is nearly incapable of lying, qualities which make some doubt Dagana's wisdom in selecting her to lead. Nonetheless, she holds the clan's survival and success in the highest regard and makes many personal sacrifices for the greater good.
