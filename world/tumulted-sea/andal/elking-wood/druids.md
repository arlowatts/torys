The druids of the forest are people of many different races who have taken the power of the [[Eclipse]] into their hearts and allowed it to shape them. A druid harnessing this dark power is known as [[Druid of the Eclipse]]. Though this power grants them many abilities, such as shapechanging and powerful magic, it also twists their desires and drives them to greed and hatred. Though they generally live alone or in pairs, there is a sort of community between some of the druids. They may provide help to each other in times of need, or offer food and shelter to another druid far from home.
