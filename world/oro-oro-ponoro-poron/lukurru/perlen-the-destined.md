Perlen the Destined is the son and only heir of [[Irvini the Seer]], leader of the Lukurru clan. He is proud, shameless, and a capable warrior. Perlen is much despised by the clan and many share the opinion that he is entirely unfit to rule---even his mother Irvini would go to great lengths to see that he does not succeed her. However, barring exile from the clan, there is no accommodation within Lukurru law to prevent a rightful heir from taking leadership.

Perlen leads a gang of ruffians in [[Woodrock]] which he incites to many kinds of trouble, including attacking or intimidating kobolds of the [[Bekebel]] clan wherever he can find them.
