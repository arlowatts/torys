Perexel is a small but ancient clan, and is allied with [[Bekebel]]. Unlike most clans on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, Perexel worships no dragon. They live beneath the trees in the jungle around [[Bekebel Citadel:Bekebel]] and are unrivaled in their knowledge of the jungle.

## The Legend of Dreth the Merciless

[[Dreth the Merciless]] was a powerful druid of the Perexel clan. She lived many centuries ago, when Perexel still worshiped the wyverns of the jungle. Dreth, having great ambition, leveraged her druidic powers to gain influence and control in the clan, all but supplanting its leader. But leading the clan was not enough for Dreth the Merciless. She sought greater and greater power, never satisfied with what she had. Then, during the longest night of the year, she discovered the shadow dragon [[Ice]] resting in a shallow cave. Dreth addressed the dragon.

> Ice, dragon of shadow. I am Dreth the Merciless, the greatest druid to have ever lived. Will you not grant me some of your power?

Ice replied,

> You have ambition, Dreth, but not strength. You cannot have my power.

Disappointed, Dreth left and returned to her clan. For a year, Dreth honed her magic and increased her abilities tenfold. She hid the truth of her meeting with Ice, afraid of her clan's judgement if she were to fail the dragon's test a second time. Then, again on during the longest night of the year, Dreth returned to the same site and found the dragon waiting for her. Again she addressed Ice.

> Ice, dragon of shadow. I have gazed upon lands no other eyes have seen and formed spells no other hand has cast. I am great but I could be greater. Will you not grant your power to me?

And again Ice replied,

> Your body is strong and your mind is stronger, but you offer me nothing. I will not give you power.

Frustrated, Dreth returned again to her clan. This time she resolved to be successful, and she spent a year crafting an amulet imbued with untold magic. The amulet was the greatest artifact her clan had ever seen, and she was not able to hide it from them. So she told the clan of her plan, and when the time came they watched her depart into the forest. At the same place as before, she found Ice and addressed the dragon.

> Ice, dragon of shadow. I bring you an amulet of my own creation. It is an offering to you and a demonstration of my power, in exchange for yours.

This time, Ice thought for a moment. Then it said,

> Dreth, you have demonstrated your power and proven your devotion. I will give you what you ask for. But my power cannot be held unless you release the shackles binding you to this world. Will you agree?

Dreth agreed immediately. When she did, the amulet crumbled to dust in her hands and she felt her magic leave her. Her physical strength also vanished, and her vision darkened. She turned to speak with Ice, but she found that the dragon had gone. With no strength left in her, Dreth collapsed in the shallow cave.

She awoke early the next morning and began to walk towards her village. As she trudged weakly through the forest, she found that the thick undergrowth and tangling vines no longer hindered her progress---she moved through them as though through shallow water. Knowing this to be the magic of Ice, she continued. The longer she walked the faster she ran, and the more joyous she became, until even the mightiest trees proved no obstacle for Dreth. In her elation, she hardly noticed that her vision was darkening more and more.

Soon she could see nothing at all, but she did not know it for she had closed her eyes against the rushing air. She flew now, on dragon's wings, and the land itself moved aside to let her pass. As she glided through the jungle, she felt a welling in her chest and exhaled black fire before her. But she did not know that she had reached her village, and the black fire destroyed many of her clan's houses before she passed through and disappeared into the jungle. Then, lost in the joy of flight, Dreth soared for many years before she finally opened her eyes. When she did, she called herself Ice and remembered nothing of her past or of the Perexel clan.

The Perexel clan's village was ruined, and many of its people killed, by Dreth's fire. Not knowing if the dragon would return, they fled their village and hid in the jungle. They hid themselves even from the small wyverns, whom they used to worship, afraid that they may be angry with the clan for Dreth's disloyalty. Though they never again saw Dreth or Ice or any other shadow dragon, the Perexel clan did not return to their village. To this day, they live under the stars and keep only those belongings which they can carry. They worship no dragons and serve no master, recalling the devastation of centuries past.
