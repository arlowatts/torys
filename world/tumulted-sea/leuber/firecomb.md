title: Firecomb
---

**Firecomb** is a port city on the south coast of **Leuber**. It serves as the main shipping contact from Leuber to **Sibal** and has developed a strong economy as a result. The city is pressed up tightly between the **Encord Mountains** and the **Tumulted Sea**, so all of its growth has only extended it farther along the coast rather than farther inland. Firecomb city is led by **Lady Tenuri**.

Clouds tend to cluster above Firecomb and it is almost always raining, with only a couple weeks of respite in the summer. From afar, the wisps of smoke rising from the city's chimneys make it appear as though it is burning, giving it the name Firecomb.
