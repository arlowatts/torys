At over 600 years old, Tuvdak the Magnificent is the oldest fire-breathing dragon on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Tuvdak is the undisputed king of the caldera, having driven off or killed no less than eight younger challengers desiring his hoard. He won his current lair from Sarvol the Peerless after an epic battle lasting days, cementing Tuvdak's reputation as one to be reckoned with. Tuvdak's victory and Sarvol's death marked the end of an era on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron.
