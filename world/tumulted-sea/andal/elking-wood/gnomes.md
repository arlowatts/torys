title: Gnomes
---

Gnomes have lived in the **Elking Wood** since long before the elven kingdom arose, and will likely continue to dwell there long after the last elf on the continent is dead. The gnomes have adapted to life under the **Eclipse** and have learned to use magic derived from plants and fungi rather than darkness. This gives them the ability to protect themselves from hostile creatures and cultivate nourishing crops. In the time of the elven kingdom it also helped them stay mostly hidden from elven law.
