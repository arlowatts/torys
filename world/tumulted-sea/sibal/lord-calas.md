title: Lord Calas
---

**Lord Calas**, a strong-minded and long-lived elf, has been the ruler of **Sibal** for nearly a century. Under his rule, the nearby countries of **Andal**, **Leuber**, **Soale**, and **Arastes** have thrived on Sibal's commerce and the merchants of Sibal have profited immensely.

Many resent Lord Calas's long reign and would rather see shorter offices for their leaders. Riots are common in Sibal's poorer districts, but Lord Calas consistently refuses the rioter's demands and relies on his police forces to disarm them.
