background:
    'In his early life he was a great leader of gnomes deep in the forest, where Eclipses are longer and more potent. When Osazii knew he was near death, he traveled alone into the deepest and darkest parts of the forest to seek a way to extend his life. At the [[Noon-night Horizon]], he found the power of the Eclipse and accepted it. Thus Osazii''s already impressive magical abilities increased tenfold, granting him near immortality. Osazii returned to his people, but they rejected him for his choices and did not believe that he had truly outmatched the corruption of the Eclipse.


    When his people denounced him, Osazii nearly killed them for the insult; however, he realized that doing so would make him exactly what they said he would become. Knowing there was nothing he could do to prevent it, Osazii accepted his exile and returned to the loneliness of the forest, never to return. For 8000 years he has lived in and traveled the forest, claiming dominion over its lands.'

Osazii is a [[Druid of the Eclipse]] who has been harnessing both the power of natural growth and the power of the [[Eclipse]] for over 8000 years. Osazii has been across every acre of the Elking Wood, and knows all the names by which it is called in other parts of the world. He has come to know every type of plant, animal, and fungi that lives in it, as well as every culture and race. He knows many ways of traveling in the forest and appears in surprising places at unexpected times. You can never find Osazii; if your business with him is important enough, he will see that you meet him.
