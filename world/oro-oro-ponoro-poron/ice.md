title: Ice
---

While dragons, drakes, and wyverns generally make their presence known, a single shadow dragon known as **Ice** resides always just out of sight. Ice is rarely seen on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, appearing only to stalk and kill roving groups of kobolds or smaller dragons. Ice's true name is not known, and no kobold clan worships them - some even doubt Ice is real. However, those seeking power beyond their means might leave a small offering in the jungle, hoping Ice will discover it and pay a visit.
