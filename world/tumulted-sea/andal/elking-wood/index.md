title: Elking Wood
---

**Elking Wood** is a large forest enclosing the westward end of **Andal**. It hosts mainly ash trees, as well as many types of shrubs and ferns. Among the undergrowth and on trees grow many different types of fungi: edible, deadly, and everything in between. Fungi are very common and are normally found in diverse clumps. In terms of animals, the forest is populated primarily by wolves and elk, but also by various birds, giant spiders, and a few basilisks. Small rodents, birds, and insects are also common.

A thousand years ago, a large and powerful elven kingdom lay over a large portion of the forest, ruled over by King **Oeged Naaftet Oecheisev**. In a fit of madness and lust for power, Oeged transformed himself into a shadow dragon and unwittingly unleashed a terrible corruption into the forest. This magic made lycantrhopes far more powerful and granted basilisks the ability to petrify any living creature with only a gaze.

The ruins of the kingdom can still be found throughout the forest. Some them are still inhabited and others are little more than rubble. Hints of roads may be found as well, all but covered by dirt and plants.
