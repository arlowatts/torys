Quabreet is the master of religions in Day's End. He is a [[Dancer]], but he lost the ability to fly when he was struck by lightning in a storm. Quabreet is an adept storyteller and an excellent listener. Having spent most of his life studying religions, he also knows the practices and prayers of most religions present in Andal. Together these qualities allow him to offer religious guidance and assistance to all the members of Day's End. He maintains the town's temple and spends his days and nights there.
