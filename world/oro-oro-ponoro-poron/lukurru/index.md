The Lukurru clan dwells in the thick jungle on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, occupying a vast territory. They worship all wyverns, whom they interact with daily in many aspects of their lives. Above all, however, they praise [[Mosha the All-knowing]], who guides the clan with her near-omniscience and punishes their failures with death.

## Woodrock

[[Woodrock]] is a village at the heart of the Lukurru lands. Though it is the largest of the Lukurru villages, it is small compared to [[Bekebel|Bekebel Citadel]] and is barely fortified. Nonetheless, it has never been taken by invaders thanks to the clan's well-organized and well-informed fighting force.

## Highvine Watch

[[Highvine Watch]] is a tall standing stone tucked away deep in the jungle. It is the seat of [[Irvini the Seer]], leader of the Lukurru, who oversees the clan's activities from afar with powerful divination magic. Highvine Watch is entirely undefended except by a small staff of seasoned warriors, but it is hidden from sight by an illusion spell cast on the site once every hundred years.
