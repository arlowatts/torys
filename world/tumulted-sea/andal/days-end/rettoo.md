Rettoo is a merchant that often visits Day's End. He brings unique food items, art pieces, rare fabrics and more from his travels and sells them to the isolated community. Then he buys wood and paper products to resell in towns that are far from [[Elking Wood]]. Whenever he visits Day's End, he brings news from eastern lands and tells stories to children and lumberjacks alike.
