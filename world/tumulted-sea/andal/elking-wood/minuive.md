background:
    'In his youth, Minu''ive trained in the arts of diplomacy and fabric-weaving. His father, the king, personally trained him night after night to have a sharp mind and a confident air. He also showed him how to craft fabrics of almost impossible colors and textures, a skill which Oeged had a particular aptitude for. Ca''ive, on the other hand, studied the arts of literature and of the sword. He read the works of past and present writers and was praised for his elegant and thought-provoking poetry. Trained by his mother Shilii in combat, he was a very capable fighter and a well-respected duelist.


    As Minu''ive and Ca''ive grew older, they became more independent from their parents and began to engage in other activities. Together, encouraged by their parents'' official position on the matter, they studied magic and learned how to draw on the power of the Eclipse. They had only been practicing for less than a decade, however, when Oeged began his spell to transform himself into a shadow dragon. The brothers were not in the council chamber at the time, and did not believe what they heard from those who were fleeing. They hurried to the palace but did not reach it before the doors were sealed. They went to look for their mother Shilii, but in the chaos they could not find her.


    In the following hours, basilisks, werewolves, and giant spiders appeared in the city and in the palace. Basilisks came out of hiding or hibernation, drawn by the surge of dark power; elves who had been using Eclipse magic for long enough were forced into monstrous forms; and hunting spiders grew to ten times their original size, large enough to attack even small groups. The people fled the city, into the forest or across the plains. Minu''ive and Ca''ive fled with a group into the forest, but they were attacked and scattered. Alone, they could hear nothing but distant cries with no direction, and completely lost their bearings in the darkness. All they had were the clothes on their backs and the sword at Ca''ive''s side.


    They wandered, trying to find their way back to their people, but all the forest seemed unfamiliar and hostile. Just as they were about to stop for the night in a small clearing, a large basilisk stepped out from the undergrowth in front of them. It caught them by surprise and Ca''ive was unable to avert his gaze in time. Yet even as he began to turn to stone, he lunged forward and stabbed the basilisk in the head, killing it. Minu''ive tried to save his brother, but with his minimal magical training he failed. Ca''ive froze in place and never moved again.


    Minu''ive wept for his lost brother and spent the rest of the night in that clearing. Had he recalled more of magical his teachings, though, he might have fled; for a basilisk is known to release the magic in its body when it dies. Sleeping near one, on such a dark night, would surely have an effect on Minu''ive. And indeed, when he awoke, he had been transformed into a [[Werewolf]].


    Knowing he could no longer be with his people, Minu''ive resigned himself to his fate and began a life isolated from the world. Near the clearing that still holds the stone form of Ca''ive, he found a tall oak tree and constructed a small platform in its branches. He has now lived there for nearly a thousand years; his long life can likely be attributed to his lycanthropy, giving him increased strength and stamina, and to his diet, consisting mostly of hand-cultivated (and slightly magical) fungi.


    During his isolation, Minu''ive has forgotten many things. He no longer remembers his own name or those of his parents, though he knows Ca''ive''s name and that he was his brother. He still goes to maintain Ca''ive''s stone form and keep it clean of vines but does not remember exactly why. He does not remember the elven kingdom or any other details of his past. His ability to communicate has also greatly deteriorated; all the diplomacy he once knew is gone and he has a hard time focusing on conversation. He talks to plants, fungi, and himself often and struggles to understand what people want from him.'
