title: Ondo the Inspired
---

[[Ondo the Inspired]] is an old Lukurru war general. He trains the Lukurru soldiers and draws up battle plans when he is called upon to defend Lukurru territories or invade its neighbors. Despite his profession, Ondo is in fact very non-confrontational and is one of the few Lukurru who would treat the [[Bekebel]] as allies if he could.
