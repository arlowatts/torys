title: Oro-oro-ponoro-poron
---

The great island-mountain of **Oro-oro-ponoro-poron** is home to many of Torys' greatest dragons. Lying in one of Torys' tropical regions and further heated by the island's volcanic peak, the island is covered in lush vegetation even in the coldest winters. The slopes climb steeply from the shore, and are crisscrossed with switchback trails cut into the stone.

## Dragons

Many types of dragons inhabit Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Green dragons lurk in the thick undergrowth while red dragons make their lairs near flowing lava. Blue dragons perch on offshore pillars of stone, and a single black dragon known as **Ice** keeps themself well hidden from those who seek them.

## Kobolds

In addition to its draconic inhabitants, Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is home to the many kobold clans who worship them. The kobolds thrive in the island's warm environment and work industriously to ensure their clan's success, often in direct competition with one another. Nearly all clans worship one or more dragons, and a clan's draconic overlord often determines the nature of their alliances.

## The Caldera

The caldera of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is a sight to behold. It is filled with churning magma, emitting tremendous heat and noxious fumes. Dragons and kobolds alike hold superstitions about the caldera, and many who peer into the magmatic crater are changed by it. Some sorcerers only learn how to work magic after they have visited the site, while others claim to see visions of distant times in the hot air. Visions from the caldera are often unpleasant, depicting fiery death and destruction.

## Wildlife

In addition to dragons and kobolds, the jungles of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron are inhabited by a plethora of wild animals.

### Chupacabras

The chupacabra is a dog-like creature with four powerful legs and a high arching back. It stalks its prey in total silence, waiting until the last moment to pounce. Chupacabras live and hunt in small packs of two to three. They mostly avoid gangs of kobolds, preferring to stay well hidden in the safety of the jungle.

### Stonebeaks

Stonebeaks are large flightless birds that subsist on anything that doesn't move. The wander the jungles in flocks of ten to twenty in search of lush undergrowth, carcasses, and the nests of their own kind. Dragons, kobolds, and chupacabras alike prey on stonebeaks.
