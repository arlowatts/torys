title: Werewolves
---

The werewolves are the most individualistic of all the cultures in Elking Wood. They almost exclusively live alone, rarely communicate with one another, and compete fiercely for territory and resources. However, there are some common traits that most werewolves share. For example, when a humanoid is infected with lycanthropy, they generally become more direct and lose some of their ability to plan ahead. This leads to decisions favoring immediate gain, such as fighting and killing trespassers rather than asking too many questions.
