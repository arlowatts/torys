title: Irvini the Seer
layout: character

personality:
    'Irvini is miserly with her words and expressions. Accustomed to solitary rumination at Highvine Watch, she has a tendency to abandon conversations before they''ve finished. However, she is in fact extremely attentive and rarely misses a single detail. She tries to redirect people''s thoughts and throw them off balance in order to confuse them into revealing some information she''s after.'

motives:
    'Irvini, like all Lukurru leaders before her, is sworn by oath to protect the Lukurru clan and its members from harm. In her time serving the clan, she has worked tirelessly in her duty and has excelled as a result. However, she is also motivated by consideration for her unruly son [[Perlen the Destined]]. She is often frustrated by Perlen''s behavior, who sometimes seems to act opposite to the clan''s needs, but still tries to protect him.'

background:
    'Irvini was trained in the divination school at [[Woodrock]].'

Irvini the Seer is the leader of the Lukurru. She watches over the clan from her seat at [[Highvine Watch]] and regularly communes with [[Mosha the All-knowing]]. Like Mosha, Irvini forcefully drives the clan to success. Using divination magic, Mosha and Irvini can identify threats to the clan, whether external or internal, before they become a danger.
