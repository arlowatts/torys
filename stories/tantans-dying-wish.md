overview:
    'Nestled between pillars of rock near the shores of [[Oro-oro-ponoro-poron]], a scheme has been brewing in the mind of [[Takala the Spellmaster]]. Takala is a powerful and respected member of the [[Dagana]] clan and an advisor to their leader [[Semeret the Motherly]]. Knowing that [[Dagana the Azure Death]] is nearing the end of her life, many Dagana clan members have begun plotting to replace her with their favored successor. Takala and others wish for the strength and protection of [[Kormak the Havoc Raiser]] and want him to be their clan''s next overlord. Kormak is fierce and ruthless, much like Dagana once was, and his followers believe he would lead them to greatness. However, Kormak does not yet hold respect from the majority of the clan---in particular, [[Semeret the Motherly]] despises Kormak and would like nothing better than to see him perish during one of his frequent fights.


    In order to foster reverence for Kormak among the clan, Takala has devised a plan with the aid of an assassin named [[Hitch]]. Their plan is to take advantage of the existing enmity between the [[Bekebel]] and the [[Lukurru]] clans and to spark a war between them. By joining forces with the Bekebel clan, [[Kormak the Havoc Raiser]] could lead the Dagana clan to a great victory over the Lukurru. Kormak prefers to fight the Lukurru because he knows that [[Tuvdak the Magnificent]], overlord and protector of the Bekebel clan, is one of the few dragons on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron that could defeat him in single combat. Defeating the Lukurru would also allow the Dagana clan to occupy their territories, expanding into the lush jungles.


    For years, Takala has been waiting for an opportunity to set her scheme in motion, and now she sees the perfect opportunity to do so at Tantan and Babanak''s wedding. With the [[Lukurru]] present in [[Bekebel Citadel]], the Bekebel will already be wary and suspicious of their ancient enemies. So, both to weaken the Bekebel clan and to inspire vengeance against the Lukurru, Takala hired the killer [[Hitch]] to assassinate both Tantan and Babanak. Even if Hitch fails, she expects the attack to spark a fierce retribution from the Bekebel.'

For many years, [[Tantan the Inventor]] and [[Babanak the Great]] of the [[Bekebel]] clan have had a close relationship. They would have married long ago were it not for the dire warnings given by Babanak's seers, who foresaw death and betrayal were the two to marry. But many years have passed, and both Tantan and Babanak have grown tired of the seers' vague forebodings.

Now the wedding is planned for the longest day of the year, and the leaders of all the nearby clans are invited. [[Semeret the Motherly]] and her retinue will represent the [[Dagana]] clan, while [[Irvini the Seer]] will attend on behalf of the [[Lukurru]]. The tense history between the three clans sets the stage for plots, schemes, and machinations---can you uncover them all before it's too late?
