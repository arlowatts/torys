title: Tumulted Sea
---

The nations of the Tumulted Sea are driven by trade, diplomacy, and profit. They work against each other as often as they work together, and information travels quickly through countless spy networks. In [[Andal]], wealthy oligarchs command impossible taxes from their starving populace. In [[Leuber]], a stranger is not a friend, and even a friend may not be an ally. [[Sibal]], the center of trade for all nations bordering the Tumulted Sea, is a writhing mass of illicit dealings and diplomatic crimes.
