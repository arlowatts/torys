title: Dagana the Azure Death
---

[[Dagana the Azure Death]] is an ancient drake living just off the coast of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. She is the oldest dragon on the island, and her age has stripped from her all of her former strength. Despite her weakness, she remains the overlord of the [[Dagana]] clan, and her history of war keeps challengers at bay.

In her prime, Dagana was one of the most feared warlords on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. She commanded a legion of armed soldiers, which would later become her namesake clan, and only the largest dragons could stand against her in battle. She claimed countless treasures and built her clan from nothing, an uncommon achievement on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron.

As she aged, Dagana entrusted more of her warmongering to her clan, and spent her time beneath the waves among her treasures. Sleeping for days or weeks at a time, her clan learned to defend themselves from other dragons and built floating homes on the water. Now, 800 years after her hatching, Dagana emerges from the sea only during the most violent storms. Her clan knows it will not be long before she emerges for the last time, and some have begun plotting to replace her when she does.
