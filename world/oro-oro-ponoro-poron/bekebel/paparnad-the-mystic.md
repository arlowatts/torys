title: Paparnad the Mystic
layout: character

personality:
    'Paparnad is mostly reclusive and not very talkative, rarely initiating any social interactions. He spends most of his time in his study or workshop, developing new magic largely in secret. When he does work with other people, he speaks dryly and without humour. He has a tendency to ignore what people are saying and to leave conversations abruptly.'

motives:
    'Paparnad is driven by a strong ambition for absolute power. He socializes very little and doesn''t believe in the greater good, acknowledging the clan''s needs only when it suits his agenda. Even as Babanak''s likely successor to rule the clan, Paparnad is unsatisfied with his position. He hopes to find magical powers great enough to set him apart from any sorcerer, druid, or seer on [[Oro-oro-ponoro-poron]]. Knowing that publicizing his true desires could jeopardize his status in the clan, Paparnad keeps his hunt for power secret from even his closest friends, and especially from Babanak and Elned.'

background:
    'The only child of two private tutors, Paparnad received possibly the best early education available in [[Bekebel Citadel]]. His parents ensured that he had the resources to pursue his interests from a very young age, enabling him to explore niche subjects. In particular, his parents'' professions enabled them to borrow or purchase rare books of arcane magic for Paparnad to study. He consumed them eagerly and spent hours every day practicing magic spells.


    Paparnad showed exceptional talent in magic and, by the time he was 20 years old, his abilities surpassed the teachings of the books available to him in the citadel. He purchased a workshop and began developing new arcane spells and techniques, quickly gaining the attention of other sorcerers and artificers. Now, five years later, he works with some of the best in Bekebel, including [[Babanak the Great]] and [[Elned the Wise]], and has taken two students [[Satasha the Runed]] and [[Taccar the Arcane]].'

Paparnad the Mystic is a young but talented wizard. Since sorcery is common among the [[Bekebel]], few bother to study arcane magic. Because of this, Paparnad has made himself useful with a unique set of spells.

He has risen quickly from an independent student of magic to one of [[Babanak the Great]]'s most trusted advisors. His talents and ambition are so great that many consider him to be the clear choice as Babanak's successor.
