title: Lord Tayossa

Lord Tayossa is the resident judge of Day's End. Technically higher-ranking than Usen, she insists on being addressed by her proper title. She never smiles or laughs, but this does not stop her from making insulting or crude jokes at others' expense - it only makes them more awkward and irritating.
