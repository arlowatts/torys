title: Ondo the Inspired
---

Ondo the Inspired is an old Lukurru war general. He trains the Lukurru soldiers and draws up battle plans when he is called upon to defend Lukurru territories or invade its neighbors. Despite his profession, Ondo is in fact very non-confrontational and is one of the few Lukurru who would treat the [[Bekebel]] as allies if he could.

<spoiler>
## Personality

Ondo is soft-spoken and will do anything to avoid an argument or a fight.

## Motives

Having witnessed the tragedies of war first-hand, Ondo hopes to create a world without conflict in which the [[Bekebel]], [[Lukurru]], and [[Dagana]] clans can coexist in peace.

## Background

Ondo fought as a foot soldier during the tail end of the war between the [[Bekebel]] and the [[Lukurru]], and only became a general later. Now he drills the Lukurru soldiers and practices maneuvers in the jungle.
