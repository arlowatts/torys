Takala the Spellmaster is one of the Dagana clan's most powerful wizards. A master of the arcane, Takala is sometimes considered to be the ideal leader of the Dagana clan. She is sharp, commanding, and refuses to back down in the face of adversity. In her, many see the spirit of Dagana's past.

Takala is committed to seeing that past return and has been scheming for many years to replace [[Dagana the Azure Death]] with [[Kormak the Havoc Raiser]] when Dagana dies. Kormak is an unstoppable killer and thrives on victory in battle, much like Dagana in her youth.
