title: Sibal
---

**Sibal** is a hub of commerce and trade for four nearby countries: **Leuber** to the north, **Arastes** to the south, **Andal** to the northeast, and **Soale** to the southwest. This small island is entirely developed from coast to coast and is one of the largest cities on Torys. Anyone and anything can be found in Sibal and money is the name of the game, so whatever can't be purchased in the bustling streets and markets can always be found in a back alley or cellar. Coins of any currency are accepted, but it is just as common to exchange goods based on value. The year-round shopkeepers are adept at sweetening their words and are very sensitive to the smallest exaggeration of value. Newcomers may find themselves swindled out of their socks if they're not careful. Literal robbery is also common in Sibal; almost anyone will pick your pocket if they think they can get away with it.

## Culture

All the races of the world are represented in Sibal. Only the merfolk, living beneath the waves, have no business on land.

## Government

Sibal has been ruled by **Lord Calas** for nearly a century. **Lord Chewan**, the harbourmaster of **Trapwater Bay**, also holds significant power in Sibal.

## Geography

Sibal lies in the inner half of Torys and the **Eclipse** occurs shortly after midday every day. Since it receives less sunlight, Sibal is colder than other places of the same latitude, especially in the winter. Druids, warlocks, and masters of the arcane can all take advantage of the power of the Eclipse to bolster their magic, at the risk of their spells working against them.
