personality:
motives:
- 'Ahahbu has a dark secret; she is, in fact, a [[Druid of the Eclipse]]. Though her powers would be relatively weak even during the noon-night, she becomes stronger with each passing Eclipse. Druids of the Eclipse, like lycanthropes, derive their strength from the night-in-the-day, and become more powerful where the Eclipses are longer and more extreme. Much farther west of Day''s End, it would be nearly impossible for a powerful druid to resist the corruption the darkness brings. Ahahbu is not severely affected because her powers are few as it is, and the Eclipses are very brief in Day''s End. But she does feel the pull towards the darkness, and is slowly learning to use more magic.'
