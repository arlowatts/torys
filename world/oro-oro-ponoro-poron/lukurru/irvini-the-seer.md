title: Irvini the Seer
---

[[Irvini the Seer]] is the leader of the Lukurru. She watches over the clan from her seat at [[Highvine Watch]] and regularly communes with [[Mosha the All-knowing]]. Like Mosha, Irvini forcefully drives the clan to success. Using divination magic, Mosha and Irvini can identify threats to the clan, whether external or internal, before they become a danger.

Irvini is miserly with her words and expressions. Accustomed to solitary rumination at Highvine Watch, she has a tendency to abandon conversations before they've finished. However, she is extremely attentive and rarely misses a single detail.
