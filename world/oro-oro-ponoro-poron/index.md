The great island-mountain of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is home to many of Torys' greatest dragons. Lying in one of Torys' tropical regions and further heated by the island's volcanic peak, the island is covered in lush vegetation even in the coldest winters. The slopes climb steeply from the shore, and are crisscrossed with switchback trails cut into the stone.

## Dragons, Drakes, and Wyverns

Many types of flying reptiles inhabit Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, collectively known as dragons. Small and sly wyverns lurk in the thick undergrowth while fire-breathing dragons make their lairs near flowing lava. Fierce drakes perch on offshore pillars of stone, and a single shadow dragon known as [[Ice]] keeps themself well hidden from those who seek them. Other well-known dragons include [[Tuvdak the Magnificent]], [[Mosha the All-knowing]], and [[Dagana the Azure Death]].

## Kobolds

In addition to its draconic inhabitants, Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is home to the many kobold clans who worship them. The kobolds thrive in the island's warm environment and work industriously to ensure their clan's success, often in direct competition with one another. Nearly all clans worship one or more dragons, and a clan's draconic overlord often determines the nature of its alliances. Some notable clans are the [[Bekebel]], [[Lukurru]], [[Dagana]], and [[Perexel]] clans.

## The Caldera

The caldera of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron is a sight to behold. It is filled with churning magma, emitting tremendous heat and noxious fumes. Dragons and kobolds alike hold superstitions about the caldera, and many who peer into the magmatic crater are changed by it. Some sorcerers only learn how to work magic after they have visited the site, while others claim to see visions of distant times in the hot air. Visions from the caldera are often unpleasant, depicting fiery death and destruction.

## Wildlife

In addition to dragons and kobolds, the jungles of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron are inhabited by a plethora of wild animals.

### Chupacabras

The chupacabra is a dog-like creature with four powerful legs and a high arching back. It stalks its prey in total silence, waiting until the last moment to pounce. Chupacabras live and hunt alone. They mostly avoid gangs of kobolds, preferring to stay well hidden in the safety of the jungle.

### Moas

Moas are large flightless birds that subsist on a variety of plants around the island, and are also known to eat small rocks to help digest their food. They wander the jungles in flocks of three to eight in search of lush undergrowth and shelter from the local predators. Dragons, kobolds, and chupacabras alike prey on moas.

### Goats

Goats wander the island in small herds of five to twelve. They are quick and nimble on the steep terrain, and can easily escape most non-aerial predators. Many domesticated goat herds are kept by the kobold clans.
