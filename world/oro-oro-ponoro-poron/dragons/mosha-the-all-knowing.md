title: Mosha the All-knowing
---

One of the smallest of the already diminutive wyverns, [[Mosha the All-knowing]] roams the jungle near the foot of the mountain and creeps unseen upon her prey. She wanders free from any lair and often visits the outposts and villages of the [[Lukurru]] clan, offering wisdom to strengthen them against their enemies. Though she accepts no offerings, Mosha expects greatness from her devotees and punishes their failures with death. Her appearance of omniscience is given by her powerful divination magic, allowing her to observe events across great distances and through many barriers.
