**Lord Chewan** is the harbourmaster of **Sibal**'s **Trapwater Bay**. He tirelessly coordinates all of the ships in the harbour to ensure that every merchant vessel can come and go as needed. Due to his success as a harbourmaster, many fishers and merchants consider Lord Chewan to be a far more capable leader than **Lord Calas**.
