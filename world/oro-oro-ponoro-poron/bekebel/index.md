Bekebel is the largest and most influential clan on Oro-oro-ponoro-poron. Within the impenetrable [[Bekebel Citadel]], the Bekebel work tirelessly to sustain their massive population and to enlarge their domain.

The clan worships [[Tuvdak the Magnificent]], both earning his protection and suffering his greed. To satisfy Tuvdak, the clan offers him a gift on every ninth day and a greater gift on every eighty-first day. The gifts are crafted by [[Babanak the Great]], a powerful sorcerer and the ruler of Bekebel.

## Bekebel Citadel

Bekebel has inhabited Bekebel Citadel for hundreds of years, expanding its borders both above and below ground.

Bekebel Citadel is a great fortress built on the slopes of Oro-oro-ponoro-poron, covering nearly one square mile on the surface and hosting over 12 miles of underground halls and chambers below. Its walls are staunchly defended by archers and advanced weapons of war, including ballistas, trebuchets, and massive bolas, all designed to take down attacking dragons. The wall itself is 30 feet thick and braced by metal beams.

The main compound is packed with rough buildings and winding alleys, bustling at all hours. The kobolds of the Bekebel clan are hard-working and industrious, laboring day and night to enlarge their citadel, develop new technologies, or create offerings for Tuvdak. The underground areas are similarly busy, especially near the surface---except that where livestock might be herded above, carts of metal and coal are hauled below.
