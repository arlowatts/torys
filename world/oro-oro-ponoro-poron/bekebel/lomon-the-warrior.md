title: Lomon the Warrior
layout: character

personality:
    'Lomon has a grim and stony-faced demeanor, and she quietly refuses to brag about her achievements. This has resulted in countless rumors, some utterly outlandish and others completely plausible, which she allows to spread and evolve across the island. She never talks back or answers questions unless absolutely necessary, and she is extremely private about her social life. In fact, only her closest friends even know that she is married, and even fewer know that she actually has a warm and supportive relationship with her husband.'

motives:
    'Lomon''s primary drive is to keep the [[Bekebel]] clan safe from the [[Lukurru]] clan, who she still perceives as a threat despite more than 30 years of peace. She doesn''t often meddle in diplomatic or political affairs, preferring to leave such things to the experts. She also hopes to retire soon from her position as commander of the [[Bekebel Elite Guard]] in order to develop her personal and social life, but she refuses to do so without assurance that her successor will keep the clan safe to her high standards.'

background:
    'Lomon joined the [[Bekebel]] fighting force shortly after the fighting stopped between them and the [[Lukurru]]. She initially served as a guard on the walls of the citadel, watching for wyverns, but when her strength and fighting prowess became clear she was promoted to a scout. As a scout, Lomon led small forces into the jungle to observe the borders of the Lukurru territory and to spy on their activities.


    On one such expedition, a wyvern attacked her group. Separated from her squad, Lomon tried to flee further into the jungle, hoping to hide from the wyvern and quietly return to the citadel. But her movements were slowed by the thick undergrowth, and the wyvern quickly caught up with her. With no escape, Lomon lunged at the wyvern and pierced its shoulder with her blade. Wounded but not dissuaded, it jumped onto her and attacked her. The battle that ensued is only remembered in Lomon''s scars, which serve as proof of her unprecedented accomplishment. Already known in the clan as a capable warrior, her victory over the wyvern made her a living legend in [[Bekebel]] history.'
